	/* You should leverage what you have learned about methods to create a method called doubleMe() which takes 
	 * in an integer as a parameter, doubles that value, and returns the newly doubled value. Print out the result 
	 * of the number at the beginning of the method and the result after being doubled.

Stretch Goal #1
Create a new method called quadrupleMe() that takes in a number, quadruples the parameter, and returns the newly 
doubled value. It should use the doubleMe() method to double the value twice. Print out the result of the number 
at the beginning of the method and after being quadrupled.

Stretch Goal #2
Write a new method called doubleMe() which takes in two parameters. The first parameter should be the value that 
should be doubled, and the second parameter should be how many times you want to double that value. For example, 
if the value 2 and 3 were passed in, the value would be doubled one to produce 4, twice to produce 8, and then 
three times to produce 16. Print out the result of the number at the beginning of the method and after being doubled 
some number of times.
